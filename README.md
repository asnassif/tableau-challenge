### Extraploating the period under review (from Jun-19 to Aug-19) for New York has showed the following:

### There are 4 main drivers which had significantly impacted the usage of Citi Bike as follows:

* Gender and Age
* Weather Conditions
* Location of Docking Stations

### Important Notes: 
* some users didn't disclose their gender, therefore the unknown gender number was excluded to give more context to the analysis and Dashboard visualizations
* According to CitiBike website: Subscribers referes to Annual Membership, while Non-Subscribers are Short-term passes which is  perfect for tourists and visitors 




## 1- Gender and Age:






### A-Gender

By breakingdown the customer base of Citi Bike by gender, the ratio of customers who had identified their gender as Male was more than 72% of the total customerbase, while Female customers were only 23%. This ratio supports what came in some researches that women are less likely to feel safe" on a bike than men particularly in an area with lots of car traffic in cities. Also the lack of bike lanes is another factor which has significantly impacted women's decision. Also women don't feel safe carying their bags while biking unless they carry a a back bag.

### B- Age:
   
By taking a closer look at the age of Subscribers and Non-Subsribers, it has showed that the average age of Female Subscribers+Un-Subscribers was 36 years old, while average Male age was 38 years old. The average age could be an indicator that in addition of using the bikes for commute purposes, it could be also for used as a kind of excerise since most people in that age range don't have time to got to the Gym and workout.

## 2-Weather Conditions:

The weather conditions had came in the second place among the factors which had impacted customers' decision to ride bikes during the perioed under review i.e. "summer time". The Analysis had revealed that as the weather gets more hot and humid, the number of Subscribers decrease, this is supported by the fact that the number of Subscribers had stepped down to 1,530 million subscribers in Aug-19 from 1,595 million subscribers in Jun-19, reflecting by that a decrease of 4%.
The decrease in Subscribers were offset by an increase in Non-Subscribers. The increase in Non-Subscribers had stemmed from an increase in Tourists/Vistors numbers who normally visit New York in the summer time. This is based on the fact that the best time to visit New York City is from April to June and September to early November when the weather is warm and pleasant according to Tourism Agencies and websites recommendations.

## 3- Location of Docking Stations:

By analyzing the trips made during the period under review, it was found that most of the trips were originated from docking stations located at Manhattan and Midtown areas. This shows that most of the Subscribers use it to commute back from work in Manahattan specially lower Manhattan and Midtown, while the Non-Subscribers use the bikes in the same areas since these areas have most of the outlets and places that any tourist would be interested in visting in NY such as Wall Street,  World Trade Center and Broadway Theaters,.....etc.

## By further analyzing the data, some intersting facts were uncoverd, which may have a dirct impact on the profitability per customer, which needs futher analysis and launching marketing campaigns to attract different customer segments:

### Average Trip Duration (Subscribers + Un-Subscribers):

* The number of Subscribers+Un-Sunscribers consistently decreases during summer time

* During the period under review the average Female trip duration was approximatelty 19 minutes/trip, while average Male trip duration was constantly declining as the weather gets more hot, i.e in Jun-19 the average trip duration was 16 minutes, while it was 15 minutes in July and August of the same year. This could be due higher speed Male Subscribers+Un-Subscribers maintain during their trips, to avoid being out in the hot weather for a longer time, or they use the Bikes for shorter trips for the same reason, i.e. avoiding the hot weather.

* The highest traffic Start Docking Station was located at Liberty St & South End Ave, New York, NY 10080 (Lower Manhattan), and on the other hand side one of the lowest traffic Start Docking Stations was located at Front St & Jay St at Brooklyn. This fact supports the idea that Citi Bikes are mostly used to commute from Manhattan and Mid-Town by Employees working in those areas and Tourists in the same areas as cheper and reliable method to commute.
